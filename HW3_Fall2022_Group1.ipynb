        "In the [lecture notebook](https://github.com/jeremyallenjacobson/qtm350/blob/master/CourseAssets/Rekognition_notebook/AWS-ML-API.ipynb) we walked you through setting up Sagemaker in the Educate account in order to use the AWS ML APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task in this question is to select another ML service from AWS and then, using the documentation, create a walkthrough similar to the one from lecture for the ML service that you picked.\n",
        "\n",
        "In your walkthrough, demonstrate how to call the service from within a Sagemaker notebook using either the AWS CLI or the Python SDK (your pick).\n",
        "\n",
        "As always, be sure to narrate your code with lots of text, images, and links to share. Explain which ML APIs you were interested in, which you tried but couldn't use, and potential use cases that you would like to explore as well as data sources you would like to apply them to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, because we can't run Sagemaker code in a colab notebook, convert your walkthrough notebook from this exercise into a .html file using `jupyter nbconvert` as the command line. Then, create an S3 bucket, upload the .html file to your bucket, and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.html) for making the .html available as a webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        " Share the link to it in this notebook, so that I and other students can read your walkthrough."
